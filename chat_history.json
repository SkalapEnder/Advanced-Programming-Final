        " The image you've provided is of the Flag of the United States, which features 13 alternating red and white stripes on a blue field, with 50 white stars arranged in a circle on the upper left corner of the flag. The flag was officially adopted by the United States Congress on July 4, 1776. It has been widely used as a symbol of national pride and unity in the United States.\n\nThe second image is also of the Flag of the United States, but this one has a color scheme that matches the Pantone Color System. The third image shows the flag with an additional depiction of stars from May 1, 1795, which was the date when the flag was first used.\n\nThe images all show the same flag design, but they differ in size and color scheme.
